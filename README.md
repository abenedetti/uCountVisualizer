# uCountVisualizer
uCount Visualizer renews uCount with a breath of freshness: data examination has been made more easy and charts section was improved with additional plots. Moreover moving the project in [R](https://www.r-project.org) under [shiny apps](https://www.shinyapps.io) framework, gave it a readiness for further improvements.

uCount Visualizer is available [here](http://apps.alessiobenedetti.com/shiny/uCountVis).
