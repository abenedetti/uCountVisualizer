<p><i>Home section</i></p>
<p2>This is the welcome page of the application. It contain a bunch of information and insights concerning the app.</p2>

<br>

<p><i>Data section</i></p>
<p2>This is the *substrate* of the app: the data with which the charts are made is loaded and represented in a tabular form in this tab. The fields of the table are those collected by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlB1XxdITwGejHKXyL_yd8XCxkoCVh5RatQeaH2CJ4Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">uCount</a>.
The table can be filtered by using the provided control that can be reset with the appropriate button. In addition an aggregation summary of the variation fields and a download button that creates a csv report are available.
The data is refreshed on each load (keep in mind that uCount retrieves data on daily basis).
</p2>

<br>
	
<p><i>Charts section</i></p>
<p2>In this section the data is displayed through 6 charts, organized in three categories:
<br>
<ul>
 <li type="square">"Visualizer charts" tab: these are the new charts created on purpose for uCount Visualizer</li>
 <li type="square">"Katung's charts" tab: these are "baptized" after Robin Khun. Robin, better known among uTesters as <a href="https://www.utest.com/profile/Katung/about" target="_blank">@Katung</a>, is a member of the uTest Community. She is a very active user and entitled as a uTest forum moderator. To thank for her interest in uCount, as well as the analysis she did, I decided to include a couple of plot she made, obviously named after their authoress. Thanks again Robin! :)</li>
 <li type="square">"uCount's charts" tab: these charts have a "legacy flavor" since the plot displayed are those that were initially made on uCount</li>
</ul>

<p2>I released *uCount* the 17 of March 2016 on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script" target="_blank">google scripting platform</a>. It has the objective to retrieve the number of followers associated to some particular uTest accounts.
Since those particular accounts were made for the entire uTesters community, under certain limits, they would give an estimation of the uTesters population, which was an information I was interested in.
Beside the data collection, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlB1XxdITwGejHKXyL_yd8XCxkoCVh5RatQeaH2CJ4Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">uCount</a> was provided with an aggregation view and a couple of charts.<br><br>
A few months later I started to think on how to integrate additional charts and analytics, and after a quick recon I've decided to move the project under the <a href="https://www.r-project.org" target="_blank">R</a> language and <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io" target="_blank">shiny apps</a> framework which are a powerful open source combination to develop web applications.<br>
<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlB1XxdITwGejHKXyL_yd8XCxkoCVh5RatQeaH2CJ4Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">uCount</a> will continue to be available, but from now his role will essentially be as a simple data scraper.</p2>
