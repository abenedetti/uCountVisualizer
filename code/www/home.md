<b><p style="color:red;">Starting 20/12/2018, uTest has changed the way you may look at utesters data. Now you should be logged in to be able to see other uTesters stats. uCount is therefore unable to retrieve the data he was used too. I've therefore decided to stop the project. You'll still be able to see the data gathered so far.</p></b>
<br>
<b><p style="color:red;">Starting 10/10/2019, the project is moved back on <i>shinyapps.io</i>.</p></b>
